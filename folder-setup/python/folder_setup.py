"""
Reusable helpers for secure ADKP data ingress: auditing a study's Synapse
folder tree and permissions, safely creating/renaming/moving/removing staging
folders, and uploading contributor files with checksum verification and
provenance.

Business rules come from:
  - SOP "ADTR 1-1.0 Data Ingress" (Confluence AD space, page 3380641793)
  - SOP "ADTR 1-2.0 Data Release" (Confluence AD space, page 2865233921) -
    explicitly notes AD Knowledge Portal uses a nested folder structure while
    ELITE Portal uses a flattened one. Other programs (GENIE, HTAN, and
    others) each have their own documented, different folder conventions.
    THIS SCRIPT MAKES NO ASSUMPTION ABOUT FOLDER ARRANGEMENT - it audits
    whatever tree actually exists under ROOT_SYN_ID and only changes what
    FOLDER_PLAN explicitly declares. Don't add logic elsewhere in this file
    that assumes a "Staging"/"Data" pair, a fixed depth, or any particular
    naming - confirm the real arrangement for a given ticket by running this
    script's audit mode first.
  - "Sage AWS Provisioner" (Confluence IT space, page 708083719) - AWS
    environments and STS credential requirements
  - "Configuration and Maintenance Standard" (Confluence SISP space, page
    2627895297) - Sage's InfoSec requirement for "dynamic encryption of
    connections" (TLS in transit) on any production/priority system
(all fetched 2026-09-17; re-check if conventions seem to have changed).

Setup:
    pip install -r requirements.txt   # synapseclient, and boto3 only if you
                                       # hit an external/STS storage location
                                       # (see check_storage_location() below)
    Authenticate once via `synapse config` (~/.synapseConfig) or by setting
    the SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN env var to a personal access token - do not
    hardcode credentials in this file.

To use: edit the CONFIG dict below (the only thing you should need to
change), then run this file directly (`python folder_setup.py`). It
always prints a validation report (current tree + permission audit +
storage-location check + proposed folder/upload changes); it only writes to
Synapse if CONFIG["dry_run"] is False and there are no ERROR-level issues.

On security:
  - All Synapse API traffic goes over HTTPS by default; login_once() asserts
    this rather than assuming it, since Sage IT has had to fix at least one
    endpoint that allowed plain HTTP (SEC-514).
  - Synapse's own managed storage already lives on Sage-operated, encrypted
    S3 behind that HTTPS-only API - for the common case (default Synapse
    storage location) this script's normal upload path already satisfies
    "encrypted in transit + at rest" with no separate AWS setup needed.
  - Direct AWS/S3 access is only relevant if a folder is bound to an
    *external* STS-enabled storage location (see SYNPY-1049) rather than
    default Synapse storage. check_storage_location() detects this per
    folder; if found, CONFIG["external_storage_confirmed"] must be
    explicitly set True (after verifying with Sage IT that the bucket is
    provisioned in the 'scicomp' AWS environment, per the AWS Provisioner
    SOP - PHI/controlled data may never live in 'sandbox') before this
    script will upload to it.
